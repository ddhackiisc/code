Contains a bunch of smiles datasets

nr-ar.smiles

Each line of the file contains a smiles string, Compound name and a 1 or 0 depending on its androgen receptor activity. Line separator is a space.

Taken from https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp which has many more interesting datasets I haven't checked out yet
