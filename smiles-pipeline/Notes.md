The Morgan fingerprint is basically a reimplementation of the extended conectivity fingerprint (ECFP). There is a paper describing it if you want more details but in essence you go through each atom of the molecule and obtain all possible paths through this atom with a specific radius. Then each unique path is hashed into a number with a maximum based on bit number. The higher the radius, the bigger fragments are encoded. So a Morgan radius 2 has all paths found in Morgan radius 1 and then some additional ones. In general, people use radius 2 (similar to ECFP4) and 3 (similar to ECFP6). As for number of bits it depends on your dataset. The higher bit number the more discriminative your fingerprint can be. If you have a large and diverse dataset but only have 32 bits, it will not be good. I would start at 1024 bits but also check higher numbers and see if you are losing too much information.

Baseline Matthews appears to be 0.2, which is pretty bad
