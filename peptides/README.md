## Notes on generating antiviral peptides

Can we train a discriminator to simply identify Antiviral peptides vs normal peptides?
Would be a useful starting point, because if it doesn't work its unlikely our gan 
would generate peptides that are likely to be antiviral

might be possible to seed the GAN discriminator, or perhaps add an "antiviral score" to the training
